I found a Glitch to escape the boarder from A Race In Need for Speed Undercover.

(INFO) I ONLY TESTED IT IN THE WII VERSION (because i have no other version) IT COULD BE ONLY IN THE WII VERSION.

So, Play Need for speed until you have Carrer progress at 87% so that you get this mission. (NFS_UC_IMAGE_01.jpg)

After that Start this mission and get to this point. (NFS_UC_IMAGE_02.jpg)

Then, just drive along the way. And you are out of the boarder. I don't know if it was discovered already, but i want just wanted to that.
